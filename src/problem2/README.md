# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to run React with Vite, supporting HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and applying some ESLint rules.

Currently, there are two official plugins available for use with Vite and React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable Fast Refresh, allowing React code changes to be reflected instantly without needing a full page reload.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/), a faster JavaScript compiler, to enable Fast Refresh, making React development smoother and faster.

### Explanation:

- **Vite** is a fast and modern build tool for web applications, optimizing development time with features like HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **Fast Refresh** is a feature in React that updates the UI without losing component state during development.
- **Babel** is a popular JavaScript compiler, while **SWC** is a faster alternative, particularly beneficial for large projects.

This template allows for a quick start with Vite and React, providing the option between two compilers (Babel or SWC) based on your needs.
